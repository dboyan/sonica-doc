# Introduction

Sonica (**S**oftware-defined **O**pen **N**B-**I**oT Resear**c**h Pl**a**tform)
provides an open-source NB-IoT testbed that is able to communicate with commodity off-the-shelf (COTS) devices.
It implements NB-IoT version of eNodeB and an EPC with Cellular
Internet-of-Things (CIoT) extensions.
Thus it provides a platform for quick prototyping and/or verification
on various layers of the NB-IoT network.
